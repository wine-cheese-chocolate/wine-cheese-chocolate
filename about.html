                Join wineLA for a special class bringing together three divine creations: Wine, Cheese and Chocolate! You will explore the sensual contrasts and delights that each element brings to the experience -the crisp acidity, mouth-filling robustness or smooth viscosity of great wine; the sharp, subtly sweet or complexity of fine cheese; and the rich luxuriousness of superior chocolate ranging from creamy milk to intensely dark.
